Deploy a Scalable Web Application on AWS EC2 with Auto-Scaling
Overview
This project involves deploying a web application on AWS EC2 instances with auto-scaling to ensure high availability during traffic spikes. It utilizes an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to distribute incoming traffic and maintains performance by automatically scaling the number of instances based on demand.

Features
Set up an EC2 instance with a web server (Apache).
Configure auto-scaling groups to adjust the number of instances based on traffic.
Enable load balancing for effective traffic distribution across instances.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
An AWS account.
Basic understanding of AWS EC2, Load Balancer, and Auto Scaling.
Setting Up the Environment
Launch EC2 Instances:

Log in to your AWS Management Console.
Navigate to EC2 and launch instances with the appropriate settings.
Install a web server (Apache) on your instances.
bash
Copy code
sudo su
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y httpd
cd /var/www/html
nano index.html   # Add your HTML content here
systemctl start httpd
Create a Load Balancer:

In the EC2 dashboard, go to "Load Balancers" and create an Application Load Balancer.
Configure health checks and register your EC2 instances as targets.
Set Up Auto Scaling:

Navigate to "Auto Scaling Groups" in the EC2 dashboard and create a new group.
Choose the launch template, specify capacity settings, and attach the Load Balancer.
Load Testing
Conduct load testing to simulate traffic spikes and observe how the system responds:

Use tools like Apache JMeter to generate traffic and monitor the application's performance.
Ensure that the Auto Scaling group scales up and down based on the specified policies.
Monitoring
Use AWS CloudWatch to monitor the performance of the Load Balancer and Auto Scaling group.
Check the health status of your instances to ensure they are functioning correctly.
Conclusion
By following this guide, you can successfully deploy a scalable web application on AWS using EC2 instances with Auto Scaling and Load Balancing, ensuring high availability and responsiveness during varying traffic loads.
